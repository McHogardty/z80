# Breadboard z80

This repo contains code and schematics relating to my breadboard z80 project. I've tried to organise the code into folders that progressed as I built out the board. My general process was to add one component at a time, then write some assembly to test it before moving on to the next component.

I use z88dk/z80asm for assembling the code. This will allow me to also write C code for it in the future.
